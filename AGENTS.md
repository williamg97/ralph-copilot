# AGENTS.md → Moved

Project configuration has moved to [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md),
which is natively picked up by GitHub Copilot with no additional configuration.

If you have existing tools that read `AGENTS.md`, update them to read `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
instead — or keep both files in sync if needed for non-Copilot tooling.
