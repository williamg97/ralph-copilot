# Project Agent Configuration

This file provides project-specific context for AI coding agents (Ralph loop, Coder subagent, etc.).

## Preflight

Run these commands to validate changes before marking a task complete:

```bash
# Replace with your project's actual commands:
# just preflight
# npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test
# make checks
echo "⚠️  No preflight commands configured — update AGENTS.md with your project's checks"
```

## Project Context

<!-- Describe your project's architecture, tech stack, and key design decisions here -->

- **Language/Runtime**: (e.g., TypeScript / Node.js 20)
- **Framework**: (e.g., Next.js 14, Express, FastAPI)
- **Database**: (e.g., PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM)
- **Testing**: (e.g., Vitest, Jest, pytest)
- **Build tool**: (e.g., Vite, Webpack, esbuild)
- **Package manager**: (e.g., pnpm, npm, yarn, cargo)

## Conventions

- **Commit format**: Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`)
- **Branch naming**: `feature/{feature-name-kebab-case}`, `fix/{issue-id}` — Ralph-generated branches use `feature/` prefix derived from the plan's feature name in kebab-case
- **Test files**: Co-located with source (e.g., `foo.test.ts` next to `foo.ts`)
- **Code style**: Enforced by linter — do not override

## Directory Structure

<!-- Describe key directories so agents know where things go -->

```
src/           # Application source code
tests/         # Test files (if not co-located)
tasks/         # PRD and plan artifacts (generated by agents)
docs/          # Documentation
```

## Notes for AI Agents

- Always run preflight before marking a task complete
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase — don't introduce new frameworks or libraries without explicit approval
- When unsure about architecture, read `02.plan.md` in the current PRD folder
- Commit after each completed task with a conventional commit message
- Ralph loop auto-creates and checks out the feature branch from `PROGRESS.md` — no manual branch setup needed
