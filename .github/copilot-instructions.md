# Project Agent Configuration

This file is auto-loaded by VS Code Copilot. It provides project-specific context for all AI
interactions, including the Forge agent pipeline.

## Preflight

Run these commands to validate changes before marking a task complete:

```bash
# TODO: Replace with your project's actual preflight commands. Examples:
#   just preflight
#   pnpm run lint && pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run test
#   make checks
#   cargo clippy && cargo test
echo "❌ Configure preflight in .github/copilot-instructions.md" && exit 1
```

## Project Context

<!-- TODO: Fill in your project's tech stack. Remove lines that don't apply. -->

- **Language/Runtime**: <!-- e.g., TypeScript / Node.js 20, Python 3.12, Go 1.22 -->
- **Framework**: <!-- e.g., Next.js 14, Express, FastAPI, Rails -->
- **Database**: <!-- e.g., PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM, MongoDB, SQLite -->
- **Testing**: <!-- e.g., Vitest, Jest, pytest, go test -->
- **Build tool**: <!-- e.g., Vite, Webpack, esbuild, Cargo -->
- **Package manager**: <!-- e.g., pnpm, npm, yarn, pip, cargo -->

## Coding Standards

<!-- TODO: Add your project-specific coding standards. Examples: -->
<!-- - Use functional components with hooks (no class components) -->
<!-- - Prefer named exports over default exports -->
<!-- - All functions must have JSDoc/docstring comments -->
<!-- - Error handling: use Result types, not try/catch -->

## Conventions

- **Commit format**: Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`)
- **Branch naming**: `feature/{feature-name-kebab-case}`, `fix/{issue-id}`
- **Test files**: Co-located with source (e.g., `foo.test.ts` next to `foo.ts`)
- **Code style**: Enforced by linter — do not override

## Directory Structure

<!-- TODO: Describe your project's key directories. Examples: -->

```
src/           # Application source code
tests/         # Test files (if not co-located)
tasks/         # PRD and plan artifacts (generated by agents)
docs/          # Documentation
```

## Notes for AI Agents

- Always run preflight before marking a task complete
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase — don't introduce new frameworks or libraries without explicit approval
- When unsure about architecture, read `02.plan.md` in the current PRD folder
- Commit after each completed task with a conventional commit message
- Forge commits on whichever branch you are on — check out the correct branch before starting the loop
